# Objective
- Get comfortable with some of Python's built-in and commonly used third-party libraries


Problem 1: Use the random library
```
Given a list of restaurants,
["Laut", "Random String", "Chipotle", "Eataly", "Sophie's Cuban", "Chop't", "Potbelly's"]

Write a function that takes the list of restaurants, shuffles the list,
and one by one pops out a restaurant as a recommendation.
```


Problem 2: Use the csv library
Using csv library, read in data from rock.csv, which you can download here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/cbffxkqq0ujru58/rock.csv?dl=0

- How many songs are from 1981?
- How many songs are from before 1984
- What is the earliest release year in the data? (HINT: You might have to account for/clean up dirty data)
- What are the top 20 songs by play count (HINT: use builtin sorted() function, documentation here: https://wiki.python.org/moin/HowTo/Sorting)
- Who are the top 10 most prolific artists in the data along with the number of their songs that appear in the data?
- How many different artists appear in the data?
- How songs does 'Rock' appear in the title of?
